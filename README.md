After doing 0 research and 0 testing, I came to the conclusion that all other sniping bots are inherently worse than anything I could ever make myself. For that reason, I have made my own course openning notification bot (since sniping bots can never truly snipe classes, just notify you as to when courses open, thus making them more of a spotter?) which will tell me when the courses I require are open. 

For now, written in python and uses requests to get the info from SoC then requests to send a message to my discord server.

For the future, I want to:
- Live update the sniping list without downtime
- Transition to C for that marginal increase in speed
- Add automatic course registration
